# Shooting ducks

Little web browser game based on **Chicken shooting** game I played as a child.

It has several goals:
* get hands on [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/)
* troll couple of my colleagues
* demonstration of JavaScript testing in my presentation

### Instalation

Game should run as it is. Just run `index.html` in browser.

If there is problem with serving assets install http-server and run it in project root.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
cd shooting-ducks
http-server
```
